SHARPIE is relying on Django for serving files to the user browser. Therefore, it is following the architecture of Django to organize the code i.e. decomposition of the pages in apps. For clarity we will detail briefly here the important files in our project but we recommend to look at the Django documentation for a better understanding of how the web server is working.
