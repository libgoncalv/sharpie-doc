Installation
------------

To use SHARPIE, we highly recommend to use a virtual environment such as Anaconda. If you have already installed Anaconda:

.. code-block:: console

   conda create -n sharpie_env python=3.11
   conda activate sharpie_env

Then, git clone the SHARPIE repository:

.. code-block:: console

   git clone https://github.com/hybrid-intelligence/SHARPIE.git

Install Redis server:

.. code-block:: console

   # On Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install redis-server & redis-server

Navigate to the SHARPIE directory and install the required packages:

.. code-block:: console

   cd SHARPIE
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Run in development mode
----------------

Start the web server:

.. code-block:: console

   cd webserver
   python manage.py runserver

In another terminal, start the runner:

.. code-block:: console

   cd runner
   python manage.py runserver

You can access the website at http://localhost:8000 and manage the authorized users from http://localhost:8000/admin with the username "admin" and password "password". For now there is no experiment available but you can find some examples ready to use in our `galery <https://github.com/hybrid-intelligence/SHARPIE_Gallery/>`_!

Run in production mode
------------------

For the web server:
Start by looking at the `deployment checklist <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/howto/deployment/checklist/>`_ from Django. We recommenf using the `example setup <https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploying.html#example-setups>`_ with Nginx and Supervisor from the Channels documentation.

For the runner:
We recommend using `supervisor <http://supervisord.org/>`_ to manage the runner process. You can find an example configuration file in `runner/runner_supervisor.conf`. You can modify the paths mentioned in the file to match your configuration and copy it to `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/`. Then, run: `sudo supervisorctl reread`_ and `sudo supervisorctl update`_ to apply the changes.
